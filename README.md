fuzzy-time-gb
=============

A fuzzy watchface for Pebble using British English. Reduces stress by showing approximate, textual time with a non-offensive typeface. Initially forked from the fuzzy watchface in the [Pebble SDK examples](https://github.com/pebble/pebble-sdk-examples). To make it work you're going to need the [Pebble SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com/) and ideally one of the watches as well. If you want to play around then use [CloudPebble](http://cloudpebble.net), it's really nicely done.
