fuzzy-time-gb
=============

A fuzzy watchface for Pebble using English English. Initially forked from the fuzzy watchface in the [Pebble SDK examples](https://github.com/pebble/pebble-sdk-examples). To make it work you're going to need the [Pebble SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com/) and ideally one of the watches as well.
